# -TIMER-BASED-DIGITAL-CLOCK-IMPLEMENTATION
- Developed a digital clock using an embedded system, leveraging timer interrupts to manage real-time counting of seconds, minutes, and hours.

- Controlled 7-segment displays (HEX0-HEX5) to show time in HH:MM format.

- Integrated switch inputs to adjust time manually and control the direction of a shifting LED pattern.

- Applied I/O management to handle LED and switch behaviors, ensuring accurate real-time clock functionality.
